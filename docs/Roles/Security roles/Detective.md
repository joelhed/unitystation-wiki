## Overview

As a Detective, your job is to report to crime scenes and help [Security](Roles.md#security) figure out who killed the dead body found inside a locker in Maintenance. If there's no crime scenes to look at, all you have to do is walk around, smoke cigarettes, look cool, and think you're an actual Security member even though you aren't.

please note that there currently are no detective-related items in the game. for now, just act as another security member

Once you pick Detective, you'll spawn inside your office. Make sure to open your locker, there's some useful stuff inside it. After this, it's mostly waiting. You can patrol the hallways and look through areas if you want, but you'll likely either not find anything, or get ambushed by Assistants that want your shiny revolver. Eventually, you'll see someone say that they found a dead body, with no way of knowing how they died. That's your cue to head to the crime scene, and investigate. Use your tools once they're added, and either deduce who the murderer is, or accidentally get your own DNA because you forgot to put your gloves on. Then, sick Security on the murderer, and either sit back in pride as the murderer is caught, or realise that some moronic crew member decided that they wanted to touch the body and that you've now sent Sec to arrest a probably innocent man.
