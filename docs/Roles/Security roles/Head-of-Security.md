# Head of Security
**Role type:** <font color= "#711e25">Security</font>. **Access:** <font color="#711e25">Security & cells</font>, <font color="#711e25">Brig</font>, <font color="#711e25">Armory</font>. **Difficulty:** <font color="Orange">Hard</font>.

Note:The HoS is a difficult role to fill and you should probably be experienced in [combat](Combat.md) and with [security](Roles.md#security) and [space law](Space-Law.md) before playing it.

"alright, thats it, the chemist has lubed his last tile, blow up the chemlab boys."


### Who you are

The HoS is, as the name implies, the Boss of all the [security officers](Security Officer.md) on the station, as well as the [warden](Warden.md) and [detective](Detective.md). The only people that can order him around are the [Captain](Captain.md) and any [centcom representatives](Central-Command-Officer.md). He is second in line for succession should the [captain](Captain.md) die, after the [HoP](HoP.md). The HoS' job is to order around his underlings and check in on them from time to time to make sure they are performing well, as well as to manage securities emergency response should the time come.



### managing the day-to-day

For a good portion of any round, and [possibly the entire round](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md), the station will be in a state of moderate peace where arming everyone to the teeth isn't needed. During these periods make sure that any [security officers](Security Officer.md) stay on patrol and dont stick around the Brig when they arent needed to let them nip problems in the bud. The [|warden's](Warden.md) job is to manage guns and oversee timers, and as he doesnt need to hand any out during these periods hell likely be more than able to manage any unruly prisoners and keep track of release times. During these times of calm, you should check on patrolling [officers](Security Officer.md) from time to time and build favor with the crew. Give laxer prison sentances for more minor crimes at this time, theres rarely reason to execute people yet.



### when shit hits the fan

If things start burning and exploding, it may be a good time to order the [warden](Warden.md) to open armoury. Arm your [officers](Security Officer.md) and order them on patrol. Should you trust the crew, you may give them guns, though you'd likely be better off giving them tasers and saving the guns for the heads. At these times the warden will likely be busy, and you will inevitably lose some officers. Be sure to help the [warden](Warden.md) manage the prison and direct [officers](Security Officer.md) to recover their dead friends. This is the time to give harsher sentences, killing anyone who murders crew on the spot without trial should be the norm.



### Martial Law? Whats that?

If somehow the station has gone to [|complete shit,with over half the crew dead and the station itself an atmosphereless wreck](Battle-royale.md), but a [good portion of officers have survived](So-close-to-impossible-that-it-might-as-well-not-even-exist.md), its time to enact martial law. At this point the Brig is likely non functional and the danger posed by antagonists is at its greatest.  You can likely get away with executing people for so much as not obeying orders from their superiors.



### How to not end up with your head on a pike

For any HoS, the crew can be just as much of a danger as [syndicate agents](Traitor.md) and [revolutionaries](Cargonia.md), and if you or your [officers](Security Officer.md) piss them off enough, you may find your head paraded down the hall. The best way to prevent this is to work with the [lawyer](Lawyer.md), take headsets off your prisoners, and follow [space law](Space-Law.md). During downtime you can also try and build goodwill with the crew, arresting unwanted vandals and theives yourself will both show others security is doing their job and you are doing your part to help them.
