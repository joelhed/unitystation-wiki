### **Nanotrasen**

A Megacorporation, the largest in the galaxy, that controls the station that UnityStation takes place on.

However, in one system, they discovered a system filled with a new, rare, and mysterious material: Plasma'', the discovery of which allowing Nanotrasen to become the largest corporation in the galaxy once again''.

## The Syndicate

The Syndicate isn't so much one corporation, as it is a sort of union of multiple companies, mercenary organizations, and raider groups. They are often regarded as the number one enemy of Nanotrasen, and have many times been responsible for the [destruction](Traitor.md) [of](Nuclear Operative.md) Nanotrasen's space stations.
