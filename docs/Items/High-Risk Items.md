# High Risk Items

So you’re an antagonist, maybe a traitor who needs to seal the [nukedisk](Nuclear-Authentication-Disk.md); maybe you’re a wizard who needs to swipe the captain’s whip. This page will tell you were to find items you need for that sweet green text, or the people who may be using them. (Also it is a guide of good objectives if you are looking for an "adventure")

Here is a list of (at least the vast majority of) the most wanted items in the station:

## The nuke disc

The [nuke disk](Nuclear-Authentication-Disk.md) is an item that spawns in the captains office, that means it is usually in the hands (or pockets) of the [captain](Captain.md). It is extremely powerful, because as long as the nuke code is inputed in the nuke, it can blow up the entire station.

With countless nuke disk pinpointers and a variety of antag roles specialized on taking this disk away, this is THE MOST risky item to have on your persona. People interested in this item would be:

  1) [Nuke Ops](Nuclear Operative.md). Not the most dangerous but the most consistent, and a force to be reckoned with. Their objective is to use this item to blow up the station. They are well armed and have a disk pinpointer.
  2) [Wizards](Wizard.md). Very dangerous and consistent, very well armed with their spells and magic weapons they present a big threat to the station. They most of the time dont have a disk pinpointer, but they have teleportation so beware.
  3) [Traitors](Traitor.md). By far the least dangerous and somewhat inconsistent. They may be assigned to steal the disk and leave the station, wich leaves them vulnerable to be killed while trying to leave.
  4) [Death Squad](Death-Squad.md). By far the most dangerous, but very inconsistent, as they do only appear when the wrath of the admin is too bad. They are BY FAR the most well equiped people you will find, and ARE NOT to be taken slightly. Spacing the nuke disk in order to delay the death squad is actually a valid strategy at that point, and the best option is setting the escape shuttle to arrive in the least time possible and getting out ASAP. They have a disk pinpointer.
  5) The station command. Of course, the [cap](Captain.md) is going to be on the lookout for the disk if its lost, so beware of him if you are antag.

## The Justitia

Big laser gun. Can be found in the [HoS](Head-of-Security.md)'s locker or in his person most of the time. It needs the proper keycard to be fired. Only wanted by [wizards](Wizard.md), [traitors](Traitor.md) and the [HoS](Head-of-Security.md) himself.

## The Imperator

The other big laser gun. Can be found in the [captain](Captain.md)'s locker or in his person most of the time. It also needs the proper keycard to be fired. Only wanted by [wizards](Wizard.md), [traitors](Traitor.md) and the [Captain](Captain.md) himself.

## The Chain of command

A whip made out of a chain. Can be found in the [captain](Captain.md)'s office, in his person or in some rare ocasions in the [mime](Mime.md) for some reason. It seems like the mime has a tendency to have the chain of command. It is wanted by [wizards](Wizard.md), [traitors](Traitor.md) and the [mime](Mime.md). The [captain](Captain.md) usually does not give a fuck about this item, and it is safer in his office.

## Advanced Magboots

Magnetic Boots related to the [chief engineer](Chief-Engineer.md). They work like every other magboots. They are wanted by [wizards](Wizard.md), [traitors](Traitor.md) and the engineering department in general.

## Plasma Sheets

Very flamable material with the power to give light to the entire station. It is used to power the plasma generator in the engineering department that keeps the station running, by cargo to fulfill the station´s mission (that paper printed in command consoles that nobody cares about) and by science to make very neat equipment (well, sometimes). It is wanted by those departments, by the station command (they will confiscate plasma if its seen) and by [wizards](Wizard.md), [traitors](Traitor.md). It is the most demanded item in this list, but also the most common, since it can be mined by shaft miners and the crew in various locations.

## HoS's Trenchcoat

A trenchcoat. It has no major uses. Wanted by [wizards](Wizard.md) and [traitors](Traitor.md). Sometimes the [HoS](Head-of-Security.md) will actually give a fuck about it and have it on. Sometimes it will just be hanging in his office.
